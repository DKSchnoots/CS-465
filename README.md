Architecture
- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
	Express HTML is a straightforward and easy to understand approach to front-end development. It is easy to understand and is fast when loading pages. Express falls short for complex interactions and can become buggy when working on larger scale applications. JavaScript allows for dynamic updates without the need to reload the page. It can also handle multiple events well and can be flexible for applications. Javscript does fall short when having to manage complex functions and is heavy on the performance which slows the response time. SPA’s offer seamless navigation features as well as quick response times. The initial load time and the need for the complex back end can be issues for SPA’s.
- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
	Mongo allows for the use of different structures and can still interact across them. It is flexible and allows for scalability in the long run for bigger scale projects and mass amounts of data being shared.
Functionality
- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
	Javascript is a programing language while a JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation and it allows for data interchange that is easy to read, write and maintain. JSON can also be used to parse information from different languages to move the data.
- Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
	In a few of the HTML files, some of the data could be reused, such as the button set ups and some of the trip outlines. The use of them and the ability to copy and move that around allowed for the data to be accurate and quick to put together.
Testing
- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
	API is used to facilitate the interactions from the front to the back. We used GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These are HTTP methods that define actions set to be done. An endpoint is a URL pattern associated with a specific method on a server that allows interaction with the backend services. The API plays a big part in protecting data and ensuring it stays safe.
Reflection
- How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
	I got to do a lot of trial and error when working on assignments for this course. I got to see why something worked and why it didn’t. I also got to use the guides to show me the right and wrong way to do certain tasks in full stack. I also got to build in full stack which is an experience in its own. Knowing this will help me in my new job because I may have times where ill nee to work with API’s or even other full stack features.
